# HPDC-IHTC

This is an implementation of the High-pressure die-casting model published by Hamsaiid et al. in [A. Hamasaiid, G. Dour, T. Loulou and M. S. Dargusch, International Journal of Thermal Sciences 2010, vol. 49, pp. 365-372.] for ANSYS FLUENT 18.1

The necessary derivations are available in Mathematica notebook and pdf format in the files derivations.nb and derivations.pdf

The following flowchart demonstrates how to use the model:
